ToDoApp
=======
This is an Android demo application for maintaining todo list where the user can add, delete and edit the item.

Time Spent : 5 days in total.

1st day - spent in setting up the environment like android studio, JDK and learnt the basics of developing app.

2nd day - developed the todo app with the add, delete and edit feature in the single activity.

3rd day - developed the todo app with the edit feature on a separate activity as mentioned in the pre-work.

4th day - Added the feature of storing the List Items in SQL-Lite Database.

5th day - Added the feature of adding due dates and used the cursor adaprtor to list the items with due date.

Completed user stories :

Required : User can add the item. The item gets added to the list and user can view all the items added.

Required : User can delete the items by long pressing the item.

Required : User can edit the item by single clicking the item, it would trigger the second activity where the user
          can edit the item and save the item to the list.
          
(Suggested) Persist the todo items into SQLite instead of a text file
          
(Suggested) Improve style of the todo items in the list using a custom adapter

(Suggested) Add support for completion due dates for todo items (and display within listview item)


Notes:

I added the gif workflow to the issue created.
