ToDoApp
=======
This is an Android demo application for maintaining todo list where the user can add, delete and edit the item.

Time Spent : 3 days in total.
1st day - spent in setting up the environment like android studio, JDK and learnt the basics of developing app.
2nd day - developed the todo app with the add, delete and edit feature in the single activity.
3rd day - developed the todo app with the edit feature on a separate activity as mentioned in the pre-work.

Completed user stories :
Required : User can add the item. The item gets added to the list and user can view all the items added.
Required : User can delete the items by long pressing the item.
Required : User can edit the item by single clicking the item, it would trigger the second activity where the user
          can edit the item and save the item to the list.

Notes:

I added the gif workflow to the issue created.
